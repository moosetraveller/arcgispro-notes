# Ideas for ArcGIS Pro for Improvements
- Hotkey to Run a Geoprocessing Tool [will be implemented in 2.5]
  - https://community.esri.com/thread/237173-shortcut-to-run-a-geoprocessing-tool
- Documentation for Advanced Users
  - no need to dig through step-by-step instructions
- Being able to use minimum (and maximum) zoom levels in a Map Pane
  - and/or having a hot-key to go to a zoom level
- Improvement for Back Button (if I click that Button, I want to go back to the previous Pane)
  - for example, if I open an own model from Catalog/Project and run it, I would expect to go back to Catalog
- Renaming Model Builder tools/inputs/results should allow case-sensitive changes
- Being able to use F5 (when selecting a file within a folder) to refresh current folder (in Catalog/Project)
