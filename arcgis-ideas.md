# Ideas for ArcGIS Pro for Improvements
- Hotkeys [will be implemented in 2.5]
- Documentation for Advanced Users
  - no need to dig through step-by-step instructions
- Being able to use minimum (and maximum) zoom levels in a Map Pane
  - and/or having a hot-key to go to a zoom level
- Improvement for Back Button (if I click that Button, I want to go back to the previous Pane)
  - for example, if I open an own model from Catalog/Project and run it, I would expect to go back to Catalog
- Renaming Model Builder tools/inputs/results should allow case-sensitive changes
